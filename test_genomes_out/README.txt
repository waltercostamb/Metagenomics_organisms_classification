This folder is the output folder of script fromNCBI_ID2taxID.pl. 
After running the script with the example command line, you should get a file here with the formatted genomes. You will also get a 
report file in the working directory with all the IDs that are NOT present in the example accession file, and could therefore not
be formatted.
